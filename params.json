{"name":"Treer","tagline":"Projects","body":"#### Tools for Gnu .po files\r\n\r\nGnu .po files are a file format containing language translations, used by the GNU gettext project for localizing software and managing translations. See the [GNU gettext documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html) for information about PO files.\r\n\r\nThe following tools manipulate .po files.\r\n\r\n### [popp](http://treer.github.io/POpp/)\r\n\r\nA .PO file preprocessor\r\n\r\nThe preprocessor allows your translated text to reference other items of translated text, in a way that should work within any .po editor. The use of `$include` statements is also supported, and conditional directives might be added in future.\r\n\r\n### [resgenEx](https://github.com/Treer/resgenEx)\r\n\r\nConverts Gnu .po localization files to/from other formats such as .isl and .resx\r\n\r\nresgenEx is a fork of mono's resgen. I was moving a Windows .Net project to .po files and needed a conversion tool with more capabilities. It focuses on preserving and automating comments during file conversions, and adds support for more file types, including Inno Setup .isl files.","google":"UA-48787072-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
